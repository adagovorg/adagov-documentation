# Code of Conduct

## Diversity of identity and thought.

... Diversity ensures that a community does not stagnate into a monoculture of identity or thought.

"... evaluation of ideas based upon personal identity should not touch upon physical appearance, religious beliefs, cultural backgrounds, sexual orientation, and/or national identity" - Citizenship, [Catalyst Community Moderation Guidelines](Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Catalyst-Community-Moderation-Guidelines.md#citizenship).

## Our Standards 

Catalyst Community Moderation Guidelines on [Support](Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Catalyst-Community-Moderation-Guidelines.md#support) seek to *Disagree without being disagreeable* and emphasizes *Assume good intent, Listen first, Lead with honesty and Practice civility.*

The Contributor Covenant is more prescriptive and gives [examples of behaviour](Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Contributor-Covenant-Code%20of%20Conduct.md#our-standards) that contribute to a positive environment (such as *Demonstrating empathy and kindness, Being respectful of differing opinions, Accepting responsibility and Focusing on what is best for the overall community*) and examples of unacceptable behaviour (such as *use of sexualized language or imagery, Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, harassment, publishing private information and inappropriate conduct*).

## Security

Catalyst Community Moderation Guidelines emphasise self-regulation, to *Hold yourself and others to high standards* in matters of [security](Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Catalyst-Community-Moderation-Guidelines.md#security) and to be proactive in *Preventing harassment, Extinguishing threats, Leaving the trolling behind and Sharing the power.*

The Contributor Covenant characterises security in terms of [Enforcement Responsibilities](Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Contributor-Covenant-Code%20of%20Conduct.md#enforcement-responsibilities) and requires Community leaders to be "*responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour ...*".


## Remediation / Enforcement

Catalyst Community Moderation Guidelines emphasises *Create a level playing field* and describes enforcement as [Remediation](Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Catalyst-Community-Moderation-Guidelines.md#remediation). 

### Levels of Remediation

The levels of *Remediation* escalate from :
1) a *Reminder of guidelines*,
2) through *First warning*, 
3) then a *Temporary ban* 
4) through to a *Permanent ban*.
