# THIS IS A DRAFT

# Code of Conduct

## Diversity of identity and thought.

... Diversity ensures that a community does not stagnate into a monoculture of identity or thought.

"... evaluation of ideas based upon personal identity should not touch upon physical appearance, religious beliefs, cultural backgrounds, sexual orientation, and/or national identity" - Citizenship, [Catalyst Community Moderation Guidelines](https://github.com/stephen-rowan/adagov-documentation/blob/main/Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Catalyst-Community-Moderation-Guidelines.md#citizenship).

## Our Standards 

Catalyst Community Moderation Guidelines on [Support](https://github.com/stephen-rowan/adagov-documentation/blob/main/Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Catalyst-Community-Moderation-Guidelines.md#support) seek to *Disagree without being disagreeable* and emphasizes *Assume good intent, Listen first, Lead with honesty and Practice civility.*

The Contributor Covenant is more prescriptive and gives [examples of behaviour](https://github.com/stephen-rowan/adagov-documentation/blob/main/Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Contributor-Covenant-Code%20of%20Conduct.md#our-standards) that contribute to a postive environment (such as *Demonstrating empathy and kindness, Being respectful of differing opinions, Accepting responsibility and Focusing on what is best for the overall community*) and examples of unacceptable behavior (such as *use of sexualized language or imagery, Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, harassment, publishing private information and inappropriate conduct*).

## Security

Catalyst Community Moderation Guidelines emphasise self-regulation, to *Hold yourself and others to high standards* in matters of [security](https://github.com/stephen-rowan/adagov-documentation/blob/main/Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Catalyst-Community-Moderation-Guidelines.md#security) and to be proactive in *Preventing harassment, Extinguishing threats, Leaving the trolling behind and Sharing the power.*

The Contributor Covenant charatersies securiry in terms of [Enforcement Responsibilities](https://github.com/stephen-rowan/adagov-documentation/blob/main/Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Contributor-Covenant-Code%20of%20Conduct.md#enforcement-responsibilities) and requires Community leaders to be "*responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior ...*".

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Remediation / Enforcement

Catalyst Community Moderation Guidelines describe enforcement as [Remediation](Documents/Reference/Code-of-Conduct/Catalyst-Community-Moderation-Guidelines.md#remediation)
